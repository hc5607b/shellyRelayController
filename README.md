# shellyRelayController

Controller system for Shelly Plus 1PM relay.

Relay controls hot water reserve, and is meant to warm it up at nights cheapest hours.
Script runs from different laptop 3 times a day to make sure new prices are loaded to relay. So this application needs seperate server or old laptop to control the relay.
